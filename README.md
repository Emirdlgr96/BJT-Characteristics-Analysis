## Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) Characteristics Analysis ⚡
## Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed the working principles and characteristic curves of a BJT (Bipolar Junction Transistor). The main goal was to understand how a BJT behaves as a switch and as an amplifier, which is crucial for biomedical instrumentation (like ECG amplifiers).

## What is a BJT?

A Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) is a three-terminal semiconductor device that consists of two p-n junctions. It is capable of amplifying or switching electrical signals.
Terminals: Base (B), Collector (C), Emitter (E).
Types: NPN and PNP. (In this experiment, I used BC237 NPN Transistor).

## Circuit Setup & Methodology

To observe the characteristics, I constructed two main circuits:Input Characteristics: Observing the relationship between Base Current (Ib) and Base-Emitter Voltage (Ibe).Output Characteristics: Observing the relationship between Collector Current ($I_C$) and Collector-Emitter Voltage (Ice).
